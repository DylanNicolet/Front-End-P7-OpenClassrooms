<h3 align="center">A recipe search tool with the aim of being the fastest of it's kind</h3>

>## **In a few words**
This search tool allows users to search recipes quickly using the main search bar or the advanced search bars.

Users can then refine their search further using the advanced search bars to filter the updated search outputs.


>## **Key requirements for the project**
1. Then appearance and structure should be done using only BootStrap and some personal CSS overrides.

2. Main search field should update the whole recipe results on every keypress once the field contains et least three characters.
